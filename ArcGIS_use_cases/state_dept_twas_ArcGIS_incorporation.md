# Map Travel Advisories using ArcGIS Pro
##### See [here](twaslink) for the _state_dept_twas_ function and its output.
### How to:
#### 1) Join _travel_advisories.xlsx_ with a feature layer representing countries with an ISO3 code.
#### 2) Apply a style to identify the Travel Warning/Advisory based on color.
NOTE: The style seen here is a custom style within an ArcGIS Project and is not a default style.

**RESULT:** By clicking on the intended country, you can get all the relevant State Department advisory information including the threat level, date published, OSAC Security report (if avaiable), link to the specific advisory through the department and an HTML print out of the advisory in the summary block.
